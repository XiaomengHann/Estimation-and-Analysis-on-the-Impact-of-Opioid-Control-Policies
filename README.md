# Overview
"Over the past two decades, the United States has seen a tremendous increase in the use and
abuse of prescription opioids, leading not only to a huge rise in opioid addiction, but also a
rise in prescription overdose deaths, and increasingly deaths from non-prescription opioids
like heroin and fentanyl as people who became addicted to opioids due to prescriptions
turn to illegal markets to sustain their addiction.

In this project, we'll be estimating the effectiveness of policy interventions designed
to limit the over-prescription of opioids. More specifcally, we will attempt to measure the
effect of a series of policy changes designed to limited opioid abuse in several US states
on (a) opioid drug prescriptions, and (b) mortality from drug overdoses.

Our interest in examining mortality as well as opioid prescriptions comes from the fact
that while restricting access to opioids may reduce the likelihood that future patients will end up addicted to opioids, it may drive already addicted patients to turn to alternative
forms of opioids, be those illegally purchased prescription drugs, heroin, or fentanyl. This
possibility is deeply troubling because the likelihood of overdosing on these illegal drugs
is much higher than on (monitored) prescription drugs, as it is impossible for drug users
to know the strength of illegal drugs, and because drugs like fentanyl are so potent that
as little as 3mg can be lethal.

While our substantive focus is on opioid prescribing regulations, however, it is worth
noting that in many ways you can see this as a template for policy evaluations more
broadly. This is a specific application of an approach to measuring the impact of a policy,
not a novel approach to analyzing opioid regulation.

## The Question:
The goal of this project is to answer the following question: what is the effect of opioid
drug prescription regulations on
1. the volume of opioids prescribed, and
2. drug overdose deaths.
